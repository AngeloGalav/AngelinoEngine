# AngelinoEngine

A project about making a cross-platform OpenGL 3D renderer by using the GLFW library and at which I'm working on in my spare time (if I have any since Uni is occupying most of my days).
You can follow the same guide that I'm following at https://learnopengl.com/ .


## Current Status and Milestones 

- [x] Core shader support
- [x] Texture support
- [x] Linear Tranformations
- [x] Coordinate System
- [x] 3D Viewport
- [x] Camera system
- [ ] Movable Camera
- [ ] Text rendering support
- [ ] Cross-platform compilation

...new features will be added in the future.

## How to compile

You can easily compile through the provided makefile using the ```make``` command Linux.
Windows compilation is still in WIP.

## Libraries used

- GLFW and glad for interfacing with OpenGL
- glm for algebra calculations
- std_image for image loading
